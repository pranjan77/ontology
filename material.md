Both petroplinthite and pisoliths develop from plinthite by hardening.|

This ooze is limited to areas with high biological productivity, such as the polar oceans, and upwelling zones near the equator.

Though called "red" because it sometimes takes the color of oxidized iron minerals, it is usually brownish in color. Its ultimate origin is uncertain, but red clay seems to be mostly derived from distant rivers, and windblown dust. Covering 38% of the ocean floor, it accumulates more slowly than any other sediment type, at only 0.1-0.5 cm / 1000 yr.|

Felsic lava has a  higher viscosity than other magma types. Felsic magmas can erupt at temperatures as low as 650 to 750 Â°C. Unusually hot (>950 Â°C) rhyolite lavas, however, may flow for distances of many tens of kilometres|

Paraffin is obtained from the fractional distillation of petroleum between 150 and 275 degrees Celsius, resulting in a mixture with a density of 0.78â0.81 grams per cubic centimetre. It is miscible in petroleum solvents but immiscible in water. Regardless of crude oil source or processing history, kerosene's major components are branched and straight chain alkanes and naphthenes (cycloalkanes), which normally account for at least 70% by volume. Aromatic hydrocarbons in this boiling range, such as alkylbenzenes (single ring) and alkylnaphthalenes (double ring), do not normally exceed 25% by volume of kerosene streams. Olefins are usually not present at more than 5% by volume.|

Paraffin is obtained from the fractional distillation of petroleum between 150 and 275 degrees Celsius, resulting in a mixture with a density of 0.78â0.81 grams per cubic centimetre. It is miscible in petroleum solvents but immiscible in water. Regardless of crude oil source or processing history, kerosene's major components are branched and straight chain alkanes and naphthenes (cycloalkanes), which normally account for at least 70% by volume. Aromatic hydrocarbons in this boiling range, such as alkylbenzenes (single ring) and alkylnaphthalenes (double ring), do not normally exceed 25% by volume of kerosene streams. Olefins are usually not present at more than 5% by volume.|

Natural gas is a fossil fuel formed when layers of buried plants and gases are exposed to intense heat and pressure over thousands of years.|

It takes up about 1/600th the volume of natural gas in the gaseous state. It is odorless, colorless, non-toxic and non-corrosive. LNG achieves a higher reduction in volume than compressed natural gas (CNG) so that the (volumetric) energy density of LNG is 2.4 times greater than that of CNG or 60 percent of that of diesel fuel.|
