ENVO:00002231	    alisol	Alisols are soils that have a higher clay content in the subsoil than in the topsoil as a result of pedogenetic processes (especially clay migration) leading to an argic subsoil horizon. Alisols have a low base saturation at certain depths and high-activity clays throughout the argic horizon. They lack the albeluvic tonguing as in Albeluvisols. They occur predominantly in humid tropical, humid subtropical and warm temperate regions.
ENVO:00002232	    andosol	Andosols are soils that develop in volcanic ejecta or glasses under almost any climate (except under hyperarid climate conditions). However, Andosols may also develop in other silicate-rich materials under acid weathering in humid and perhumid climates.

ENVO:00002248	    luvisol	Luvisols are soils that have a higher clay content in the subsoil than in the topsoil as a result of pedogenetic processes (especially clay migration) leading to an argic subsoil horizon.

Plinthite is an Fe-rich (in some cases also Mn-rich), humus-poor mixture of kaolinitic clay (and other products of strong weathering such as gibbsite) with quartz and other constituents that changes irreversibly to a layer with hard nodules, a hardpan or irregular aggregates on exposure to repeated wetting and drying. Petroplinthite is a continuous, fractured or broken sheet of connected, strongly cemented to indurated nodules or mottles. Pisoliths are discrete strongly cemented to indurated nodules. Both petroplinthite and pisoliths develop from plinthite by hardening.

ENVO:00002254	    vertisol	A soil in which there is a high content of expansive clay known as montmorillonite that forms deep cracks in drier seasons or years. Alternate shrinking and swelling causes self-mulching, where the soil material consistently mixes itself, causing vertisols to have an extremely deep A horizon and no B horizon.
ENVO:00002255	    solonetz	Solonetz are soils with a dense, strongly structured, clayey subsurface horizon that has a high proportion of adsorbed Na and/or Mg ions. Solonetz that contain free soda (Na2CO3) are strongly alkaline (field pH > 8.5).

In practice, Regosols are very weakly developed mineral soils in unconsolidated materials that do not have a mollic or umbric horizon, are not very shallow or very rich in gravels (Leptosols), sandy (Arenosols) or with fluvic materials (Fluvisols). Regosols are extensive in eroding lands, particularly in arid and semi-arid areas and in mountainous terrain.
ENVO:00002257	    podzol	Podzols are soils with a typically ash-grey upper subsurface horizon, bleached by loss of organic matter and iron oxides, on top of a dark accumulation horizon with brown, reddish or black illuviated humus and/or reddish Fe compounds. Podzols occur in humid areas in the boreal and temperate zones and locally also in the tropics.

Though called "red" because it sometimes takes the color of oxidized iron minerals, it is usually brownish in color. Its ultimate origin is uncertain, but red clay seems to be mostly derived from distant rivers, and windblown dust.
